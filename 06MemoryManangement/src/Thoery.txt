MEMORY MANAGEMENT IN JAVA

Memory -> RAM

Types of memory:
    1.Stack
    2.Heap

1. STACK
    temporary variable / methods
    primitive datatypes
    reference of an object
    each thread has its own memory

Garbage Collector
    -> removes non-referenced objects from heap memory

    + Strong referenced
        never gets deleted until it becomes null
        Person obj = new Person();

    + Soft Referenced.
        delete the reference when its necessary.

    + Weak Referenced
        Objects are deleted when GC runs


2. HEAP

                                        Heap                                      permGen(non Heap)
        |--------young generation--------|---------old generation----------|           metaSpace
        |--Eden------|----S0---|----S1---|---------------------------------|
        |            |   survivor space  |                                 |
        |  gc runs periodically          |     major Gc not periodically   |

GC algorithms
    -> Mark and sweep algorithm
    -> Mark and sweep algorithm with compaction

Gc Versions..
    > Serial Gc -> single thread runs to clean
    > parallel Gc -> default java8
    > Concurrent mark and sweep (CMs)
    > G1 Garbage collector / CMS with compaction
